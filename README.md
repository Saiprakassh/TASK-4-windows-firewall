# üîí Task 4 ‚Äì Setup and Use a Firewall on Windows

## üìå Objective
The goal of this task is to configure and test basic firewall rules to block specific network traffic.  
In this example, we blocked **Telnet** traffic on port **23**, which is insecure and should be disabled.

## üõ† Tools Used
- **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** (GUI)
- Windows 11
- `.wfw` Firewall Policy Export for documentation

## üìã Steps Performed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
- Press `Win + R`, type `wf.msc`, and press Enter.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Inbound Rule
- Click **Inbound Rules** ‚Üí **New Rule‚Ä¶**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Select Rule Type
- Choose **Port** ‚Üí Controls connections for TCP or UDP ports.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Choose Protocol and Port
- Protocol: **TCP**
- Specific local ports: **23** (Telnet)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Choose Action
- **Block the connection**

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Profile
- Applied to **Domain**, **Private**, and **Public** profiles.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Name the Rule

## üìñ Understanding the Task

- **Why block port 23?**  
  Telnet sends all data, including passwords, in plain text. This makes it vulnerable to interception. Secure alternatives like SSH (port 22) should be used.

- **Inbound vs. Outbound rules:**  
  - **Inbound**: Controls traffic coming **into** your system.  
  - **Outbound**: Controls traffic going **out** from your system.

- **Firewall role:**  
  A firewall filters traffic based on defined rules, helping to prevent unauthorized access.

## ‚úÖ Outcome
Successfully created a firewall rule blocking inbound TCP connections on port 23 (Telnet) for all profiles and exported the configuration.
